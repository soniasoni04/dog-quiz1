# DOG-QUIZ

## What this project is about

This is my own attempt at the week 4 React/Redux project the students do during the Academy.Goals for this project: 
- To practice for myself
- To become more comfortable with react and redux use in the programming.

## Technologies used : 
  - react
  - redux
  - redux-thunk
  
## Requirements: 

- The webapp must show the user a random picture of a dog (the Dog API provides an endpoint for this purpose), and it must ask the user to choose the correct breed name from a list of 3 options.
- When a user makes the correct choice, his score will increase by 1 and then go for next question.
- If the user makes the wrong choice, only the Total-count will increase by 1 and then go for next question.

## How to get started

- Draw some wireframes. That is, simple schematic designs that lay out all the parts of the webapp that need to be built.
- Specify the game logic.
- List all the actions the user can take. For each interaction, write down what the input information is.
- Define the shape of your state. Think about all the pieces of information that you have to store in your application state.
- Setup a React project and implement the wireframes from the previous step. 
- Fill it with dummy data so you can at least see the GUI and Push it to GitHub

## Create React App

This project was scaffolded using the create-react-app cli.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
